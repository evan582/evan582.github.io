    <h1>Why I Like to go swimming in the summer.</h1>
    <p>Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer.
        When the sun is shinning and the air is warm, you will
        find me dipping intp my backyard pool. It's not an impressive 
        pool, only three feet deep but It's mine.
    </p>
<p>There are three reasons I like to swim</p>
<ul>
    <li>I get lots of exercise</li>
    <li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
    <li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun </li>
</ul>
